ERROR CODE FORMAT
XX-YZ(W)

XX - Determines which module gave the error:
03-YZ(W) - Core Module
16-YZ(W) - Pair Module
18-YZ(W) - Rotor Module

Y - Determines what module file gave the error
XX-0Z(W) - Core.obj
XX-1Z(W) - Pair.obj [16-1Z(W)] Rotor.obj [18-1Z(W)]

Z - Determines specific error

W - Used if it is the same error that was thrown at a different point in the code
