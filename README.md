# Enigma Testing
Enigma machine implementation in C++

This branch contains the source code for the program and is used for testing new features before implementing it into the Release branch. The VS Project files here are not setup to compile the code as a static library, that can be found in the Release branch.

## Features being worked on
* Overload Encryption function to use fstream objects.
